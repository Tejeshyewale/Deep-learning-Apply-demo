# 📉 Loss Function (Basic Concept)

## What is Loss Function?

Loss function measures how much the model prediction is wrong compared to the actual value.

Small loss → Good prediction
Large loss → Bad prediction

Model training process:
Predict → Calculate Loss → Update Weights → Improve Prediction

## Example (Customer Churn)

Actual = 1 (Customer leaves)
Prediction = 0.9 → Small loss (Correct)
Prediction = 0.1 → Large loss (Wrong)

## Loss Function Used in This Project

We use **Binary Crossentropy** because output is binary:
Churn = 1
No Churn = 0

It checks how close the predicted probability is to the real answer.

## Key Point

Loss Function tells the model **how bad it is**.
Optimizer tells the model **how to improve**.
