# 🧠 Perceptron Basics (Deep Learning Concept)

## 📌 What is Perceptron?

The Perceptron is the **simplest neural network model** and the foundation of Deep Learning.
It works like a single artificial neuron that decides whether an input belongs to a class or not.

👉 It is mainly used for **Binary Classification** (Yes/No, True/False, Churn/Not Churn)

Example in this project:
Predict → Will customer leave the company?

## ⚙️ How Perceptron Works

A perceptron takes inputs, multiplies them with weights, adds bias and passes result through an activation function.

### Mathematical Formula

z = w1x1 + w2x2 + w3x3 + ... + b

Output:
If z ≥ 0 → 1 (Positive Class)
If z < 0 → 0 (Negative Class)

## 🧩 Components of Perceptron

* Inputs (x) → Customer features (tenure, charges, contract)
* Weights (w) → Importance of each feature
* Bias (b) → Threshold adjuster
* Activation Function → Decision maker (Step Function)

---

## 📊 Simple Example

Suppose we predict churn using 2 features:

* Monthly Charges
* Tenure

Weights:
w1 = 0.6
w2 = -0.4
b = -2

Customer Data:
Monthly Charges = 80
Tenure = 12

Calculation:
z = (0.6 × 80) + (-0.4 × 12) - 2
z = 48 - 4.8 - 2
z = 41.2

Since z > 0 → Output = 1 → Customer will churn

## 📉 Limitation of Perceptron

Perceptron can only solve **linearly separable problems**.
It fails when data is complex (real world customer behavior is complex).

That is why we use:
➡️ Multi-Layer Neural Network (Deep Learning)

---

## 🔗 Relation to This Project

Customer churn prediction is not simple linear behavior.
So instead of single perceptron we use **multiple neurons (ANN)** which learn complex patterns from customer data.

Perceptron = 1 neuron
Deep Learning = many neurons working together

## 🎯 Key Takeaway

Perceptron is the building block of neural networks.
Understanding perceptron helps understand how Deep Learning models make decisions.
