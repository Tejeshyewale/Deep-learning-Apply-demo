# 📊 Customer Churn Prediction using Deep Learning

## 📌 Project Overview

This project focuses on predicting whether a customer will leave (churn) a company using Deep Learning techniques. By analyzing customer behavior and account information, the model identifies high-risk customers so businesses can take preventive actions.

Customer churn prediction is important for telecom, banking, SaaS, and subscription-based companies because acquiring a new customer is much more expensive than retaining an existing one.
